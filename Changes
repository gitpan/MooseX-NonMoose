Revision history for MooseX::NonMoose

0.07    09/27/2009
    Start adding support for non-Moose destructors. Destructor inlining isn't
    supported yet, since Moose isn't quite flexible enough there for it to be
    more than an annoying hack, but this should still work with immutable
    classes anyway.

0.06    09/27/2009
    defining a custom constructor in a class using mx-nonmoose now works

    use a less broken test for whether or not a superclass has an inlined
    constructor (fixes issue uncovered by fixes to Moose's metaclass
    compatibility fixing)

0.05    06/24/2009
    gaaaaah, packaging is so stupid (remove stray test.pl file)

0.04    06/23/2009
    Add tests and official support for alternate instance metaclasses, such as
    MooseX::GlobRef and MooseX::InsideOut - including supplying a custom
    exporter MooseX::NonMoose::InsideOut which should work in all possible
    cases, when just using the same hash that the nonmoose class is using would
    break

    Fix a couple issues with inheriting from MooseX::NonMoose classes - make
    sure FOREIGNBUILDARGS is only called once, and fix some issues with
    immutability

0.03    05/06/2009
    Add a FOREIGNBUILDARGS method to support modifying the argument list passed
    to the non-Moose constructor

0.02    04/29/2009
    A few minor doc fixes

0.01    04/20/2009
    Initial release
